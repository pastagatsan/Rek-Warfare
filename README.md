# Building Rek Warfare

### Linux ###

~ Make sure you install `cmake` with your package manager (apt, yum, pacman, etc.).

~ Now you go to the directory where `Rek-Warfare` is located in, and type the following:

```
mkdir rek-build   # We want to make a separate folder for our build files
cd rek-build
```

Keeping the build files in a separate directory helps keep our source folder *clean*.

~ Assuming that you are in `rek-build`, write the command `cmake` followed by the path of the source folder

~ After CMake has finished its work, you can now type `make`

### Other Operating Systems ###

Instructions for other operating systems are currently not available. If you know how to build using another operating system, fork this repository and make a pull request with README.md edited with build instructions.
