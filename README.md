# Rek-Warfare

Awesome 2D Platform multiplayer shooting game

The game is planned to have:
- [ ] Deathmatch gamemode (not in early versions of the game)
- [ ] Capture the Flag gamemode (possibly a variant of it, who knows?)
- [ ] Customizable weapons
- [ ] Official maps
- [ ] A map-maker (possibly a separate repository?)
- [x] An in-game GUI (my own, semi-finished, but the system works)
- [ ] "Acceptable" physics (will take time, I haven't studied physics in a while)
- [ ] Translations (I can assure you that Spanish will be available right away!)
- [ ] Easter eggs (INTERNET MEMES!)
- [ ] Chat
- [ ] In-game chat commands
- [ ] Private server hosting (official public servers are a thing I can't afford)
- [ ] Private server user permissions (Sudo-user and normal-user, you get the point)
- [ ] Nicknames (may be coming real soon)
- [ ] Interactive tiles (launch pads, doors, etc., etc.)
- [ ] Music (this may not come in early versions of the game because I *currently* don't have the skills to make 8-bit music, although, I play an instrument, so it may not be that hard, right?)
- [ ] Decent quality textures (the friend whose job was to make them has not been on Skype in a while :-1:)
- [ ] Machine Protocol Language (see wiki)

**Just a short note:**

I do not have intentions of making money off this game, but eventually, when the game has progressed to a playable and enjoyable state (in other words, when most of the stuff I have on the planned list is done), I may accept donations in the future (I don't expect much).
