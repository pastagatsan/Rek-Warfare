# Rek-Warfare
Awesome 2D Platform shooting game

The game is planned to have:
* Deathmatch gamemode
* Capture the Flag gamemode (possibly a variant of it, who knows?)
* Customizable weapons
* Official maps
* A map-maker (it may be in a separate repository)
* An in-game GUI (probably make my own or use another library)
* "Acceptable" physics (will take time, I haven't studied physics in a while)
* Translations (I can assure you that Spanish will be available right away!)
* Easter eggs (INTERNET MEMES!)
* Chat
* In-game chat commands
* Private server hosting (official public servers are a thing I can't afford)
* Private server user permissions (Sudo-user and normal-user, you get the point)
* Nicknames (may be coming real soon)
* Interactive tiles (launch pads, doors, etc., etc.)
* Music (this may not come in early versions of the game because I *currently* don't have the skills to make 8-bit music, although, I play an instrument, so it may not be that hard, right?)
* Decent quality textures (the friend whose job was to make them has not been on Skype in a while :-1:)

**Just a short note:**

I do not have intentions of making money off this game, but eventually, when the game has progressed to a playable and enjoyable state (in other words, when most of the stuff I have on the planned list is done), I may accept donations in the future (I don't expect much).

**Also:** Check out another project by a group of my friends called ![zordzman-plus-plus](https://github.com/TeamLe-Shop/zordzman-plus-plus)!
